                    <p className="domainText">CAD is a software tool used for creating 2D and 3D models and designs of products or parts, which can be used for product visualization, analysis, and simulation. It allows engineers and designers to create accurate and detailed designs of their products before they are built, reducing the time and cost involved in the product development process.
                        CAE, on the other hand, is a software tool used for simulating and analysing the behaviour of products or parts under different conditions. CAE software can perform a wide range of analysis, including structural analysis, thermal analysis, fluid dynamics, and electromagnetic analysis. How do you think CAD and CAE are important tools for modern engineering?.</p>

                    <p className="domainText">Smart materials are materials that can change their properties or shape in response to external stimuli such as temperature, light, pressure, or magnetic fields. These materials have unique properties that can be controlled and manipulated to adapt to various conditions, making them highly useful in a variety of applications. Some common types of smart materials include shape memory alloys, which can change shape when exposed to heat; piezoelectric materials, which generate electricity when subjected to mechanical stress; and electrochromic materials, which change colour when an electric current is applied.

                    <p className="domainText">Supply Chain Management (SCM) is the process of planning, designing, executing, controlling, and monitoring the movement and storage of goods, services, and information from the point of origin to the point of consumption. It involves the coordination and integration of all activities involved in sourcing, procurement, production, inventory management, transportation, and distribution of goods and services. The ultimate goal of SCM is to achieve maximum efficiency and effectiveness in the supply chain by optimizing the flow of goods, reducing costs, and improving customer service. This is achieved by leveraging technology and automation, implementing best practices and continuous improvement, and collaborating with suppliers, customers, and other stakeholders. Give your views.

                    <p className="domainText">Green manufacturing is the practice of designing and producing products in an environmentally responsible manner that minimizes waste, conserves energy and natural resources, and reduces the overall environmental impact of manufacturing processes. It involves adopting sustainable manufacturing practices and technologies that are designed to reduce the negative impact of manufacturing on the environment. The goal of green manufacturing is to create a sustainable manufacturing system that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Green manufacturing can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, and the depletion of natural resources, while also improving the bottom line for manufacturers. Explain briefly. </p>

                    <p className="domainText">
                        Additive Manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing, is a process of creating three-dimensional objects by layering materials on top of each other. Unlike traditional manufacturing processes, which involve cutting, drilling, and shaping materials, AM builds up objects layer by layer using digital designs. The AM process begins with a digital design, which is created using computer-aided design (CAD) software. The design is then translated into a series of instructions that are sent to the 3D printer. The printer then builds up the object layer by layer, using materials such as plastics, metals, ceramics, and even biological materials. How do you think the capabilities of AM are likely to expand, making it an increasingly important part of modern manufacturing?

                        Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) are tiny integrated devices that combine electrical and mechanical components on a single chip. These devices typically have dimensions ranging from micrometres to millimetres, and are fabricated using processes similar to those used to manufacture integrated circuits. MEMS devices can be used for a variety of applications, including sensing, actuation, and control. They are typically made from materials such as silicon, polymers, and metals, and can be designed to perform a wide range of functions. Some common examples of MEMS devices include accelerometers, gyroscopes, microphones, and pressure sensors. Give your views on this topic

                    <p className="domainText">An automatic transmission is a type of vehicle transmission that automatically changes gear ratios as the vehicle moves, without the need for manual shifting. It uses a complex system of hydraulics, electronics, and mechanical components to smoothly and efficiently transfer power from the engine to the wheels. In an automatic transmission, the driver simply selects a driving mode, such as "drive" or "reverse," and the transmission takes care of the rest. As the vehicle accelerates, the transmission automatically shifts up through the gears to maintain optimal engine performance and fuel efficiency. When the vehicle comes to a stop, the transmission shifts down through the gears to keep the engine running smoothly. Explain briefly.

                    <p className="domainText">Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a solid-state welding technique that was developed in the 1990s. Unlike traditional welding methods, which use heat to melt and fuse materials together, FSW uses a rotating tool to join materials together without melting them. In FSW, a rotating tool with a specially designed geometry is used to stir the materials being joined together, creating friction and heat that softens the materials without melting them. The tool then moves along the joint, creating a bond between the two materials as they cool and solidify. Give your views.
