            <p className="domainHeading">Stressed Ribbon Bridge</p>
            <p className="domainText">A stressed ribbon bridge is primarily a structure under tension, which has similar geometry to that of a simple suspension bridge thus making it ideal for cycling or pedestrian traffic. The tension cables form the part of the deck which follows an inverted catenary arc between the supports. Unlike the simple suspension spans which tend to sway and bounce, the ribbon is stressed in compression which adds to the stiffness of the structure. The David Kreitzer Lake Hodges Bridge, the world's longest stress ribbon bridge, was opened to the public in May 2009. Articulate your views to improve them structurally and incorporate technical advancements.</p>
            <p className="domainHeading">Green Building</p>
            <p className="domainText">Ask any child what the biggest concern for the future of humanity is, and you are likely to receive the answer, “Saving planet Earth!”. Green Building- a revolution in itself, has been defined as the one which uses less water, optimizes energy efficiency, conserves natural resources, generates less waste and provides healthier spaces for occupants, as compared to a conventional building. With increasingly alarming evidence of global warming and its terrible effects on the planet, how are green buildings- the need of the hour?

            <p className="domainHeading">Self-Consolidating Concrete</p>
            <p className="domainText">Self-compacting concrete, also known as self-consolidating concrete, is characterized by its high fluidity. Thanks to this property, it spreads into concrete formwork with no need for vibration equipment. This non-segregating concrete is distributed by its own weight, while maintaining the properties such as durability and strength. How can the use of  self-compacting concrete be adopted using recycled aggregates?

            <p className="domainHeading">Fiber Reinforced Concrete</p>
            <p className="domainText">Fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) has received much attention in civil engineering in recent years. Fiber-reinforced concrete is ideal for improving the durability and toughness performance of concrete and mortar. Fibers in concrete help reduce shrinkage cracks, increase strength, increase energy absorption and reduce dangerous spalling at high temperatures. Enunciate your thoughts on the topic. </p>
            <p className="domainHeading">Advanced Earthquake Resistant Technique</p>
            <p className="domainText">Disasters are sudden occurrences which have unfavorably affected humans as the advent of our survival. In response to such occurrences, there have been challenges to mitigate destructive effects of these disasters. Building liability usually results from a shortage of awareness of engineering science and inadequate implementation of building codes.
                Earthquakes are one of the Earth's most destructive forces– the seismic waves throughout the ground can destroy buildings, take lives, and cost tremendous amounts of money for loss and repair. Earthquakes are so far away unpredictable and unpreventable; the only alternative is to construct and build the building structures which are earthquake resistant. Pen down your thoughts on the various advanced earthquake resistant techniques being adopted in construction nowadays.

            <p className="domainHeading">Base Isolation Building</p>
            <p className="domainText">Base isolation is a state-of-the-art method in which the structure (superstructure) is separated from the base (foundation or substructure) by introducing a suspension system. By separating the structure from its base the amount of energy that is transferred to the superstructure during an earthquake is reduced significantly. During earthquakes there will be a range of periods at which acceleration in the building will be amplified beyond maximum, though relative displacements may not exceed peak ground displacements. Thus base isolation is the ideal method to cater this issue since both acceleration and displacements are controlled. Elaborate on the topic. </p>
            <p className="domainHeading">Use of AI in Civil Engineering</p>
            <p className="domainText">Artificial intelligence has always been a far-reaching manifold technology with limitless potential across industries. It has become more sophisticated, with efficiencies feeding directly into construction processes. Today, we are witnessing the wide-scale adoption of AI in civil engineering, with smart algorithms, big data, and deep learning techniques redefining productivity performance. AI is also applied in the initial stages of many projects in design optimization, risk control, and improving productivity. Thus, in an age where machines can think rather than just do, engineers can make better judgments while discharging their services more effectively.

                With that said, dwell on the current applications of AI in civil engineering as well as pen down your thoughts on methods of amplifying smart construction with machine learning.

            <p className="domainHeading">Intelligent Transport System</p>
            <p className="domainText">With the conception of smart city transmuting cities into digital societies, making the life of its citizens easy in every facet, Intelligent Transport System becomes the indispensable component among all.
                In any city, mobility is a key concern. Intelligent Transport System (ITS) aims to achieve traffic efficiency by enriching users with prior information about traffic, local convenience, real-time running information, seat availability etc. which reduces travel time of commuters as well as enhances their safety and comfort. Articulate on the successful Implementation of a cooperative intelligent transport system utilizing weather and road observation data

            <p className="domainHeading">Mixed Traffic control</p>
            <p className="domainText">Regulation of heterogeneous traffic is a challenging task on urban roads. A mixed traffic environment consists of numerous traffic participants such as human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected automated vehicles (CAVs), fixed time traffic signal lights and adaptive traffic signal lights. Adaptive traffic signal control systems can ‘decide’ to change the signal according to intersection sensing data, such as the waiting length. However, the unpredictability of signal changes can lead to dangerous situations. The need to improve signal control efficiency and predictability for drivers in such environments makes the development of control methods a priority. In recent years, the proliferation of artificial intelligence has brought new possibilities for the development of mixed traffic control systems, part of intelligent transportation systems.

            <p className="domainHeading">Advanced Pavement Design</p>
            <p className="domainText">Developing durable and resilient pavement infrastructures is critical for current economic growth and environmental sustainability. With the rapid increment of road mileages across the world, the development of new roads in the world has almost reached saturation. However, most of the in-service roads currently face problems centered around performance degradation, especially for initially poorly constructed roads. Therefore, effective advanced pavement condition assessments, designs and M&R strategies are urgently required and prioritized in pavement engineering in order to extend pavement lifetimes.
