                            <p className="domainText">A stressed ribbon bridge is primarily a structure under tension, which has similar geometry to that of a simple suspension bridge thus making it ideal for cycling or pedestrian traffic. The tension cables form the part of the deck which follows an inverted catenary arc between the supports. Unlike the simple suspension spans which tend to sway and bounce, the ribbon is stressed in compression which adds to the stiffness of the structure. The David Kreitzer Lake Hodges Bridge, the world's longest stress ribbon bridge, was opened to the public in May 2009.

In response to such occurrences, there have been challenges to mitigate destructive effects of these disasters. Building liability usually results from a shortage of awareness of engineering science and inadequate implementation of building codes. Earthquakes are one of the Earth's most destructive forces– the seismic waves throughout the ground can destroy buildings, take lives, and cost tremendous amounts of money for loss and repair. Earthquakes are so far away unpredictable and unpreventable; the only alternative is to construct and build the building structures which are earthquake resistant. Pen down your thoughts on the various advanced earthquake resistant techniques being adopted in construction nowadays.</p>

                            <p className="domainText">Base isolation is a state-of-the-art method in which the structure (superstructure) is separated from the base (foundation or substructure) by introducing a suspension system. By separating the structure from its base the amount of energy that is transferred to the superstructure during an earthquake is reduced significantly. During earthquakes there will be a range of periods at which acceleration in the building will be amplified beyond maximum, though relative displacements may not exceed peak ground displacements. Thus base isolation is the ideal method to cater this issue since both acceleration and displacements are controlled. Elaborate on the topic.</p>

A mixed traffic environment consists of numerous traffic participants such as human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected automated vehicles (CAVs), fixed time traffic signal lights and adaptive traffic signal lights. Adaptive traffic signal control systems can ‘decide’ to change the signal according to intersection sensing data, such as the waiting length. However, the unpredictability of signal changes can lead to dangerous situations. The need to improve signal control efficiency and predictability for drivers in such environments makes the development of control methods a priority. In recent years, the proliferation of artificial intelligence has brought new possibilities for the development of mixed traffic control systems, part of intelligent transportation systems.
