                    <p className="domainText">Optical Wireless Communications (OWC) has become a promising technology for supporting high-data-rate 5G communication and the massive connectivity of IoT. OWC technologies possess a number of prominent features such as wide spectrum, high-data-rate, low latency, high security, low cost, and low energy consumption, addressing the highly demanding requirements of 5G communications. They can play an important role of sensing, monitoring, and resource sharing in massive device connectivity of IoT networks. Enunciate on this technology.</p>

                    <p className="domainText">Visible light communication (VLC) is a wireless method that enables high-speed transmission of data with visible light. This data is transmitted by modulating the intensity of light given off by a light source. The signal is received by a photodiode device that transforms the data into forms that are readable and readily-consumed by end users. It  can be used as a communications medium for ubiquitous computing, because light-producing devices (such as indoor/outdoor lamps, TVs, traffic signs, commercial displays and car headlights/taillights) are used everywhere.

                    <p className="domainText">A smart antenna is a specific type of digital antenna that has capabilities related to tracking or handling signals. They are used to increase the productivity of digital wireless communication system.Some of the most common smart antenna applications include acoustic signal processing, track and scan radar, and cellular systems such as 5G and LTE. When multiple mitigation is needed, diversity becomes a big problem. How do you think you can tame this problem?

                    <p className="domainHeading">Hybrid cars</p>
                    <p className="domainText">Hybrid cars use more than one means of propulsion that means combining petrol or diesel engines with electric motor. They consume less fuel and less emission of CO2 which makes the vehicle eco friendly as compared to conventional cars. Due to their higher complexity, hybrid vehicles are considerably more expensive than their ICE counterparts. Apart from increasing the overall purchasing cost, added tech in a hybrid car can affect maintenance costs.
