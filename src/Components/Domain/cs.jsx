Simply put, it involves creation of a digital-only "virtual" computer that behaves as if it were a physical computer with its own hardware–Virtual machines, thus forming Virtual Servers from where resources can be accessed. These resources include Applications, Servers (Physical Servers and Virtual Servers), Data Storage, Development Tools, Networking capabilities, and more—over the Internet (‘The cloud’), hosted at a remote data center and managed by a cloud service provider (or CSP) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. What are the benefits of cloud services and deployment models in the ever increasing data sector? How has it affected data management in the past few years?</p>

Image processing basically involves the following three steps. First, importing an image with an optical scanner or digital photography. Second, analysis and image management including data compression and image enhancement and visual detection patterns such as satellite imagery. Third, it produces the final stage where the result can be changed to an image or report based on image analysis .

These neural networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain–millions of interconnected neurons that work together to ‘learn’ and process information, large amounts of data in an unsupervised or semi-supervised manner. Thus the Deep Learning models makes them well-suited for tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing and provides benefits like hidden relationships and pattern recovery, unsupervised learning,  etc. With the advancement in Deep Learning, how has this field of technology helped in the health care sector?

                            <p className="domainText">Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science in which algorithms are trained using a training data set to create a model. Its  learning system has three main parts– Decision Process, Error Function and Model Optimization Process. When new input data is introduced to the ML algorithm, it makes a prediction on the basis of the model. The prediction is evaluated for accuracy and if the accuracy is acceptable, the Machine Learning algorithm is deployed. Classical, or ‘non-deep’, machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to learn. Human experts determine the set of features to understand the differences between data inputs, usually requiring more structured data to learn.

Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that enriches the user's perception, providing a live view of the real world with digital information while Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that regenerates 3D digital images and videos to create visual experiences for users. The metaverse is essentially a virtual environment, a simulation of the real world, where people can communicate with one another through a variety of technologies. Hardware and software are used in tandem to achieve this. Collaborations would mimic actual situations where AR and VR components would be combined to let people experience conditions that are not constrained by laws of physics.
