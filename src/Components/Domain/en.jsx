                    <p className="domainText">With their extensive incorporation of information and communication technology, power systems are exposed to cyber threats. By targeting the information exchange process, malicious attackers can inject false data to cause power outage, economic loss, and system instability. False data injection (FDI) can also be employed to mask existing power system faults. This will affect operator’s visibility on the faults and prevent proper countermeasures from being taken. How do you think we can manage the problem?</p>
